#' @details
#' Consider that each cell defines a point in M-dimensional space (where M is the number of markers), based on its marker intensities.
#' This function constructs hyperspheres and counts the number of cells from each sample lying within each hypersphere.
#' In this manner, the distribution of cells across the space can be quantified.
#' For each hypersphere, cell counts for all samples are reported along with the median intensity across the counted cells for each marker.
#' 
#' Each hypersphere is centered on a cell to ensure that only occupied spaces are counted.
#' However, for high-density spaces, this can result in many redundant hyperspheres.
#' To reduce computational work, only a subset of cells are used to define hyperspheres.
#' The downsampling frequency is specified by \code{downsample}, e.g., only every 10th cell is used to make a hypersphere by default.
#' 
#' Each hypersphere also has a radius of \code{tol*sqrt(M)} (this relationship avoids loss of counts as M increases).
#' \code{tol} can be interpreted as the acceptable amount of deviation in the intensity of a single marker for a given subpopulation.
#' The default value of 0.5 means that, for any one marker, cells with +0.5 or -0.5 intensity will be counted into the same subpopulation.
#' This value is sensible as intensities are usually on a log-10 scale, such that a total of 10-fold variability in marker intensities is tolerated.
#' 
#' The coordinates are reported as (weighted) medians across all cells in each hypersphere.
#' Compared to the center, the median better reflects the location of the hypersphere if the cells are not distributed around the centre.
#' Each cell is weighted inversely proportional to the total number of cells in the corresponding sample.
#' This ensures that large samples do not dominate the median calculation.
#' 
#' All hyperspheres with count sums below \code{filter} are removed by default.
#' Such hyperspheres do not have enough counts (and thus, information) for downstream analyses.
#' Removing them reduces the amount of memory required to form the output matrix.
